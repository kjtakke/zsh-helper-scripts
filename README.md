## hist Command â€” Shell History Search Utility

The `hist` function searches your shell history for commands matching a given term.  
It automatically:
- Ignores any `hist` commands to avoid self-matches
- Removes duplicates (keeping only the most recent occurrence)
- Supports time-based filtering
- Works in both **zsh** and **bash**

---
